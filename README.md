SpaceX has been considered one of the most successful companies in the commercial space age, making space travel more affordable and accessible. Much of the savings that Space X sees is because of their ability to reuse the first stage rocket motors. What can other companies, like Space Y, do to compete with Space X and reduce their operational costs?

I take a look at questions such as:
How do variables such as payload mass, launch site, types of orbit and number of flights affect the success of a first stage landing?
Does the rate of successful landings increase over the years?
What algorithms provide the greatest accuracy for predicting the success or failure of future rockets?

I went thorugh all the processes of Data Collection, Data Wrangling, EDA with SQL and Visualization, Interactive Analytics via Dashboards, and Model creation and evaluation to answer these questions.
